title: "About me"
---

At the start of my college career, I had plans to be an educator in high school math. I graduated with a degree in mathematics, but while pursuing the degree, I took an interest in data analytics. After earning my bachelor's degree, I decided to go back to school and go after a master's degree in data analytics.

Before the master's program, I did not have much experience in programming. During these 2 years, I've gotten experience in R, SQL, Python, Tableau, and various other programs. I'm hoping to get more practice using what I've learned in this program during this class.

Apart from what I do at school, I work at iHeartMedia as a Data Analyst intern, and am currently working on dashboards for the company. When I'm not at work or school, I love to read, cook, or spend time with friends and family.
